### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a researcher in applied mathematics at Ã‰cole des Ponts ([LVMT](https://www.lvmt.fr/)). My main specialties are machine learning and optimization, with a focus on applications to transport and logistics. Before that, I was a postdoc at EPFL ([INDY](https://indy.epfl.ch/) and [IdePHICS](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/idephics/)) and a visiting student at MIT ([Julia lab](https://julia.mit.edu/)).

A large part of my work is devoted to open-source scientific software in the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/).
