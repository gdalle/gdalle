### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a postdoctoral researcher in machine learning at EPFL, working between the labs [IdePHICS](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/idephics/), [SPOC](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/spoc/) and [INDY](https://indy.epfl.ch/).
My current research focuses on the behavior of graph neural networks.

Between 2019 and 2022, I was a PhD student at Ã‰cole des Ponts ([CERMICS](https://cermics-lab.enpc.fr/)), and then a teaching assistant at MIT ([JuliaLab](https://julia.mit.edu/)).
